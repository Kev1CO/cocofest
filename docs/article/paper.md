# Summary

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitation method intended to promote motor recovery notably after
neurological impairment. Applying coordinated electrical pulses to muscles elicits functional movements like walking,
reaching, and grasping. FES rehabilitation mostly relies on empirical settings, as responses to stimulation vary across
populations and muscles. Empirical settings often cause overstimulation and premature fatigue [@ibitoye2016strategies],
shortening rehabilitation sessions and diminishing therapeutic benefit. Consequently, advanced control approaches like
optimal control-driven FES are gaining interest in personalizing and improving FES rehabilitation efficiency, meanwhile
delaying muscle fatigue. To address this need, we designed `Cocofest` (Custom Optimal COntrol for Functional Electrical
STimulation), an open-source Python package for optimal control-driven FES. `Cocofest` provides a framework to generate
personalized pulse trains (Fig. 1) based on nonlinear dynamics models for FES (Table. 1), for several musculoskeletal
models and motor tasks. The package provides more than 10 examples, covering optimization of FES-related pulse train
parameters (including frequency, pulse width, pulse intensity), FES model parameters identification from in vivo
measurements, and long duration predictive simulations.

# Statement of Need

Since the pioneer study on optimal control-driven FES [@hunt1997feedback], no code has been shared in the field,
limiting objective comparison and replicability across studies. The lack of open-source practice led to an absence of
consensus on how to choose nonlinear dynamics for FES, and which cost functions to use for dedicated clinical needs,
hindering standardization and cumulative progress [@co2025optimal]. To address these challenges and support collective
scientific progress, `Cocofest` fulfills the following four needs:

Firstly, the relationship between the pulse train parameters (e.g., frequency, pulse width and intensity; Fig. 1) and
the resulting muscle force, joint torque, and muscle fatigue (termed as state variables) can be modeled with different
nonlinear dynamics [@ding2003mathematical; @veltink1992nonlinear] (Table 1). Gathering them within a unified package
would facilitate comparison for more informed modelling choices.

Secondly, no study has compared different optimal control problem (OCP) formulations ap-plied to FES, due to OCP
implementation challenges [@co2025optimal]. Easily customizable OCP formulation, involving objective functions, models,
and transcriptions is required to provide an adequate research framework. Having the possibility to switch between
several OCP transcriptions, such as direct collocation or direct multiple shooting, is essential when dealing with stiff
differential equations [@puchaud2023direct], often embed in FES models. Muscle fatigue is the primary challenge in FES.
Enabling the development and comparison of different OCP formulations could help address research questions, yield novel
stimulation patterns and enhance fatigue reduction. Moreover, using receding-horizon estimation for longer simulations
reduces the computational complexity associated with time-varying dynamics (e.g., fatigue) [@ding2003mathematical].

Thirdly, predictive simulations of FES-driven or FES-assisted motions (e.g., walking, cycling, reaching, and grasping)
require the coupling of FES models with the equations of motion as well as adequate muscle force-length-velocity
relationships. Predictive simulations are usually actuated through Hill-type muscle models [@wakeling2023review]. A
package capable of replacing muscle actuation by FES models in multibody musculoskeletal models will allow us to
simulate realistic FES-driven tasks.

Fourthly, personalized rehabilitation strategy is required to facilitate the motor recovery. Therefore, identifying the
patient-specific muscle response to FES is a crucial step. Unfortunately, current complex identification methods are a
barrier to clinical translation [@le2010identification]. Providing a robust and customizable framework for the
development of more patient-friendly protocols would help to overcome this barrier.

Overall, despite its potential, optimal control–driven FES remains unadopted in clinical practice due to its low
technology readiness level [@co2025optimal]. `Cocofest` is a comprehensive package designed to bridge the gaps and
foster clinical adoption. It integrates nonlinear muscle dynamics dedicated to FES, manages muscle fatigue, interfaces
FES with musculoskeletal models, supports customizable cost functions and parameter identification routines. With the
goal of bringing this technology to patient care, we believe this package will contribute to the open-science effort.
`Cocofest` is expected to accelerate the increase of technology readiness level by strengthening knowledge foundation.

`Cocofest` relies on Biorbd, a musculoskeletal physics engine [@michaud2021biorbd], and Bioptim, an open-source
optimization framework for biomechanical problems [@michaud2022bioptim]. Specifically, Bioptim enables easy OCP
customization including cost functions, bounds, constraints, transcription methods (e.g., direct collocation),
integration methods, and solving methods (e.g., full- and receding-horizon OCPs).

In conventional Hill-type muscle model, muscle force ($F_m$) is the product of $a$ the muscle activation, $F_{max}$ the
maximal isometric muscle force, $f_l$ the force-length, $f_v$ the force-velocity and $f_{pas}$ the passive force-length
relationship: $F_m(t) = a(t)\, F_{\max}\, f_l(\tilde{l}_m)\, f_v(\tilde{v}_m) + f_{pas}(\tilde{l}_m)$.
`Cocofest` replaces $a(t)$ × $F_{max}$ by the force obtained using FES models (e.g., Ding, Marion, Hmed). This approach
allows motions driven-FES simulations, meanwhile benefiting from musculoskeletal model properties (e.g., muscle
insertion, weight, inertial).

An identification feature is available to personalize FES models based on experimental data. Model’s parameters (e.g.,
rested force scaling factor, cross-bridges sensitivity, and time to force decline in [@ding2003mathematical] model) are
personalized by minimizing the difference between the simulated and the experimental forces.

Additionally, a feature for solving initial value problems was implemented to enable model comparison. The FES nonlinear
dynamics is integrated forward in time to simulate the model’s behavior from given initial state and controls (i.e., 
series of pulse trains). `Cocofest` also incorporates the recent numerical truncation method to speed up convergence
[@coelho2025numerical]. This method limits the number of past stimulations considered in the dynamics to reduce the
dependency on time-varying states.
